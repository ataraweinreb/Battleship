# Battleship

## Overview
Battleship is a war-themed strategy game for two players. 
Each player marks five ship locations on a 10 X 10 gameboard, and conceals the locations from the other player. 
Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. 

## Instructions
You will play against the computer. 
Run the program, and then follow the directions in the terminal to place your ships. The computer will strategically place its ships as well. You and the computer will continue to alternate "firing" at eachother's ships by typing in guesses until one of you sink the other's entire fleet.
